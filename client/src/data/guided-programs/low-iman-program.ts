Maybe prayers feel empty, maybe you feel distant from Allah, maybe you can't remember when you last felt that sweetness of faith. Know this: low iman doesn't mean you're a bad Muslim. Faith is like the moon - it waxes and wanes. The Prophet (SAW) himself told us that iman wears out like clothes wear out. You're not broken. You're human. And you're here, seeking to return. That seeking itself is a sign that your heart is still connected to Him. Let's walk this path back together, gently."

When iman is low, prayer often feels like a burden - something to check off, something that brings guilt when missed. But what if we reframed it? What if salah wasn't a chore but a meeting? Five times a day, the Creator of the universe invites you to a private audience. He's not counting your mistakes. He's welcoming your presence. Can you see prayer as coming home rather than clocking in?"
