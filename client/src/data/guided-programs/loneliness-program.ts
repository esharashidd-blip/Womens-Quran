After Khadijah (RA) died, leaving him without his greatest earthly support. He knew loneliness. And in those moments, he turned to Allah.

Being alone is a state - you're physically by yourself. Feeling lonely is an emotion - a painful sense of disconnection. Sometimes we're alone and peaceful. Sometimes we're in a crowd and desperately lonely. Understanding this difference is powerful because it means solitude itself isn't the enemy. In fact, solitude can be sweet - time with yourself and with Allah, without distraction. The goal isn't to avoid ever being alone. It's to transform alone time into something nourishing."
